## Types of Tests

**Unit Test**
Focus on individual units of code in the program (a single class, module, object or method).
> Elements are tested in isolation. The specs are easy to write and run fast.

**End-to-end (E2E)**
Acceptance test focus on a feature and its interaction with the entire system.
> Elements are tested together with a good deal of confidence. The specs are hard to write, brittle and run slow.
