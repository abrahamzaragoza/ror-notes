Metaprogramming is a technique by which you can write code that writes code by itself dynamically at runtime. This means you can define methods and classes during runtime.

**Symbols**
Ruby symbols are defined as “scalar value objects used as identifiers, mapping immutable strings to fixed internal values.” Essentially what this means is that symbols are immutable strings.

Every time a string is written, it creates a new object with a new place in memory, even if the string is textually identical to an existing string. However, since symbols are immutable, they always refer to the same object and the same place in memory.
```
Strings can hurt a program’s performance if string objects are repeatedly created and destroyed when the same object could have been reused in their place. For this reason, a program that uses symbols over strings (when possible) will run more efficiently.
```
Symbols come in handy when you need a unique identifier to hold a value, such as a key in a hash.

Symbols are objects that can be passed around like any other Ruby object. They can also be used to pass values to methods, such as in getter and setter methods in class definition:
```
class Person
  attr_accessor :name
end

person = Person.new
> #<Person:0x007ff2ad15c848>

person.name = "Mario"
> "Mario"

person.name
> "Mario"
```

**Ruby % Notation**
[source](http://ruby.zigzo.com/2014/08/21/rubys-notation/)
```
%q[ ] # Non-interpolated String (except for \\ \[ and \])
%Q[ ] # Interpolated String (default)
%r[ ] # Interpolated Regexp (flags can appear after the closing delimiter)
%i[ ] # Non-interpolated Array of symbols, separated by whitespace
%I[ ] # Interpolated Array of symbols, separated by whitespace
%w[ ] # Non-interpolated Array of words, separated by whitespace
%W[ ] # Interpolated Array of words, separated by whitespace
%x[ ] # Interpolated shell command
```
**Hashes**
A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs. The order in which you traverse a hash by either key or value may seem arbitrary and will generally not be in the insertion order. If you attempt to access a hash with a key that does not exist, the method will return nil.
create a new hash:
```
h = Hash.new

# empty hash
h = Hash[]
h = {}
```
new hash with initial entries:
```
# old way
h = {:foo => 0, :bar => 1, :baz => 2}
# new way - JSON-style
h = {foo: 0, bar: 1, baz: 2}
```
access values:
```
h[:bar]
> 1
```
creating or updating a values:
```
# creating key-value pais
h[:new] = 3

# updating value for key :foo
h[:foo] = 4
```
delete entry:
```
h.delete(:bar)
```
**Each vs Map**
* *each* executes the given block for each element of the array, then returns the array itself.

* *map* also executes the given block for each element of the array, but returns a new array whose values are the return values of each iteration of the block.

Both iterate over the array (over anything that mixes in Enumerable) but map will return an Array composed of the block results while each will just return the original Array.
```
arr = ["tokyo", "london", "rio"]

# the return value is simply the same array
# the code inside the each block gets executed, but the calculated values are not returned
arr.each { |element| element.capitalize }
> ["tokyo", "london", "rio"]

# returns a new array whose elements are the return values of each round of
# executing the map block
arr.map { |element| element.capitalize }
> ["Tokyo", "London", "Rio"]
```
