## Validations
[ActiveReacord Validations](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)
Validations are used to ensure that only valid data is saved into your database. For example, it may be important to your application to ensure that every user provides a valid email address and mailing address. Model-level validations are the best way to ensure that only valid data is saved into your database. They are database agnostic, cannot be bypassed by end users, and are convenient to test and maintain. Rails provides built-in helpers for common needs, and allows you to create your own validation methods as well.

**validation helpers**
Active Record offers many pre-defined validation helpers that you can use directly inside your class definitions. These helpers provide common validation rules. Every time a validation fails, an error is added to the object's errors collection, and this is associated with the attribute being validated.



**validation of relations**
Validates that all the instances of the model meets the validation rules.
Do not add it on both models of the relation.

```
class Library < ApplicationRecord
  has_many :books
  validates_associated :books
end
```
