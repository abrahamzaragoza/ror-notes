## Beatiful Code
Idiomatic Ruby. The goal of Ruby is to be narutal, not simple.

*Write your code so it doesn't need comments.*

### DRY
Dont Repeat Yourself
Any shared code should be placed in modules or common inherited classes.

### Code Smells
* One liner if-else
* Long conditionals
* Classes with attributes but not methods
* Long chaining JSON objects
* Too much commenting, or no comments at all
* Dead Code
* Shotgun Surgery | Making a change in a class requires a lot of changes in other clases. Make classes independent from one another.

### SOLID - Change should be maintable
Five principles
* Single Responsibility Principle
  * Avoid unwanted dependencies among functionalities
  * Create as many required classes to add to the functionality that maintains atomicity in their responsibilities
* Open/Closed Principle
  * Open for extension but Closed for modification
  * Whe can inherit from a class but can't modify the class itself
  * Risk unintended changes, something might just stop working
* Liskov Substitution Principle
  * If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S
  * Create interface methods that raise NotImplemented errors in the Base Class whenever using them for extension
* Interface Segregation Principle
  * Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use
* Dependency Inversion Principle
  * A high-level module shoudn't depend on a low-level module, both should depend on abstraction
  * Remove dependencies and decouple the main busines logic between class A which is used by class B through a caller class C

### Fat Model & Skinny Controller
* Add as many methods as possible to the model
* Try to not load with CRUD or any other operations through the data on the model
* Try using addiotional classes or mdules if it originally was on the controller
* Avoid adding anything additional to parameter management or rendering methods that will redirect to the view or the response
* Avoid placing view logic in the controller

## Rails programming paradigm

* Make Your Code Beautiful
* DRY
* Common Code Smells
* SOLID
* Fast Model. Skinny Controller
