### Authorized Persona
Authorized levels must be included in the model (user). There must be a field in the model where you include
the module AuthorizedPersona::Persona.

```
class User < ApplicationRecord
  include AuthorizedPersona::Persona

  authorization_tiers(
    trainee: 'Trainee - limited access',
    staff: 'Staff - standard access',
    admin: 'Admin - all access'
  )
  end

  validates :authorization_tier, inclusion: { in: authorization_tier_names }
```

The Application Controller must include the model that has the permission for the specified controller.

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include AuthorizedPersona::Authorization

  authorize_persona class_name: 'User'
end
```

In each controller you iwll need to specify the grant access for each of the actions.

```
class ChatroomController < ApplicationController
  grant(
    trainee: [:index, :show],
    staff: :all
  )
end
```

If you don't need authorization for a specific action

```
class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :authorize!
end
```
