### Request forgery protection
CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It inherits the identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired function on the victim’s behalf (though note that this is not true of login CSRF, a special form of the attack described below). For most sites, browser requests automatically include any credentials associated with the site, such as the user’s session cookie, IP address, Windows domain credentials, and so forth. Therefore, if the user is currently authenticated to the site, the site will have no way to distinguish between the forged request sent by the victim and a legitimate request sent by the victim.

We must ensure that Create, Update and Delete actions gets accessed only be non-GET methods.
* Done when following conventions
*  Disable for certain actions with
    ```
    skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token
    ```

### The Request Object
The request object contains a lot of useful information about the request coming in from the client.

### Response Object

### Setting Custom Headers

### Authentication
* basic auth
* digest auth

### Sending files

```
def download_pdf
  client = Client.find(params[:id])
  send_file("#{Rails.root}/files/clients/#{cliend.id}.pdf",
            filename: "#{client.name}.pdf",
            type: "application/pdf"
  )
end
```

### Log filtering

```
config.filter_parameters << :password
```

### Rescue
Rescue specific errors with rescue_from

```
def record_not_found
  render plain: "404 Not Found", status: 404
end
```

### Catching Request Errors

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  rescue from User::NotAuthorized, with: :user_not_authorized

  private

  def user_not_authorized
    flash[:error] = "You don't have access to this section."
    redirect_back(fallback_location: root_path)
  end
end

class ClientsController < ApplicationController
  # Check that the user has the right authorization to access clients
  before_action :check_authorization

  # Note how the actions don't have to worry about all the auth stuff.
  def edit
    @client = Client.find(params[:id])
  end

  private
  # If the user is exception.

  def check_authorization
    raise User::NotAuthorized unless current_user.admin?
  end
end
```

### Namespace
Create a sub-route where you can add as many resorces and paths as you'd like

```
namespace :admin do
  resorces :articles, :comments
end
```

### Collections
Collection or additional RESTful actions within a member of a resource

```
resources :photos, do
  collection do
    get 'search'
  end
end
```

### Nested Resources

### Internationalization (i18n)
