**redirect_to** promt the browser to make a new request


### Controller rendering
You can render an action's template from another controller, this would only take the view.

You can specify the layour that will be used for this view

```
render layout: "special_layour"
```

### Yield
Yield will populate the main entry of the laour.

Know that yield also accepts a key, which is populated through the content_for tag.

### Partials
Partial templates - usually just called "partials" - are another device for breaking the rendering process into more manageable chunks. With a partial, you can move the code for rendering a particular piece of a response to its own file.
