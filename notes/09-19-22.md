### Active Job
Ensures the Rails app has job runners like Delayed Job, Resque, and Sidekiq.

For enqueuing and executing jobs in production you need to set up a queuing backend, that is to say, you need to decide on a 3rd-party queuing library that Rails should use. Rails itself only provides an in-process queuing system, which only keeps the jobs in RAM.

Creatins Rails jobs

```
rails g job guests_cleanup
```

Example

```
class GuestsCleanUpJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default

  def perform(*guests)
    # Do something later
  end
end
```

### Sidekiq
Gem of choice for this course. *Redis* will also be required.

```
rails g sidekiq:job <job_name>
```

```
# For now execution
Rock::HardJob.new.perform
# To enqueue
Rock::HardJob.new.perform_async
```

### ActionMailer
You are able to use email layouts and also define from which outcoming email.

```
class ApplicationMailer < ApplicationMailer::Base
  default from: 'from@example.com"
  layout 'mailer
end
```

```
class UserMailer < ApplicationMailer
end
```

* Sent emails don't look like regular HTML views.
* There are many things we can't use in email. [Source](https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/rails-send-emails-with-style/)

**Delivery**
* .deliver_now
* .deliver_later | sends it through the default configured queue, you can specify the queue adapter.

```
config.active_job.queue_adaptar = :sidekiq
```

**SMTP Config**

```
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = true
config.action_mailer.perform_caching = false
config.action_mailer.default_url_options = ( host: "localhost', port: 3000 }
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  address: "smtp. gmail.com",
  port: 587,
  authentication: "plain",
  enable starttls auto: true,
  user_name: "blabla@gmail.com",
  password: "blabla"
  domain: "smtp.gmail.com',
  openssl_verify_mode: "none"
}
```

### Letter Opener
Preview emails in browser @development.

### JBuilder
JSON objects. Commes with new project with Rails 6.
In order to make your own REST APIs. All Request URLs must be appended with .json

**Views**
file_name.json.jbuilder

```
json.data do
  json.book do
    json.id book.id
    json.title book.title
    json.author_name book.author_name
    json.library_name book.library_name
  end
end
```

### Her Model
Adds DSL methods for REST APIs (ORM). You don't inherit from ApplicationRecord while using Her::Model

```
class Book
  include Her::Model

end
```

It needs a middleware

```
Her::API.setup url: 'http://localhost:3001/api' do |c|
  # Request
  c.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  # Response
  c.use Her::Middleware::DefaultParseJSON
  # Adapter
  c.use Faraday::Adapter::NetHttp
end
```
